                    <h1>Sen Zhang</h1>
                    <h2>Masterâ€™s in Computer Science | Johns Hopkins University (JHU)</h2>
                    <h3>Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science | University of South Carolina (USC)</h3>
                    <p>
                        An enthusiastic and dedicated Computer Science professional currently pursuing a Master's degree at 
                        Johns Hopkins University, with a Bachelor's degree from the University of South Carolina. 
                        My academic and professional journey is driven by a profound love for algorithms and software engineering, 
                        inspiring continuous learning and innovation in these fields.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a strong foundation in data structures, software engineering principles, and big data analytics, 
                        supported by a solid academic record. As a Research Assistant at USCâ€™s iMSEL Lab, 
                        I contributed to pioneering projects, including developing a computer vision model for railway monitoring, 
                        demonstrating my ability to translate theoretical knowledge into impactful real-world applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My research focuses on real-time systems, anomaly detection, image processing, and deep learning models 
                        such as Transformers and YOLO. With multiple publications showcasing my contributions, 
                        I have demonstrated a strong ability to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications.
